                <h3>DevSecOps Coaching</h3>
                <p>The DevSecOps journey is usually not easy and often can't be done by your existing workforce. 
                    An experienced coach works with the teams and people throughout the organisation to identify and prioritise
                    concrete improvements. The improvements can be big but more often they are multiple smaller changes 
                    so the changes are more likely to 'stick' and accepted.
