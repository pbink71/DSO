             <h1>Peter Bink</h1>
             <p>A seasoned IT professional with a career spanning over 25 years, my journey began in 1995 as a developer in the Netherlands. 
                Building a strong foundation in programming languages like Cobol, Pascal, and C, I subsequently 
                ventured into various roles across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
                <br>
                My focus areas within the SDLC have included Configuration & Release Management, Testing and Test Management, and Process Improvement for both 
                development and operational teams. Throughout my career, I've consistently embraced a collaborative approach, even before the widespread adoption 
                of DevSecOps principles. <br>
                Since migrating to New Zealand in 2012, I've had the privilege of working with leading organisations like NZ Defense Force, ANZ Bank, Inland Revenue, 
                ACC, Ministru of Health, Transpower, and New Zealand Health Group. For the past five years, I've held the role of a DevSecOps coach, where I've successfully guided 
                teams in implementing the latest technologies and tools, optimising DevSecOps processes, and fostering a culture that prioritises 
                collaboration and security awareness.
