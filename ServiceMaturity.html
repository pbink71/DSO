                <h2>Master your DevSecOps journey with our maturity assessment.</h2>    
                Struggling to bridge the gap between development and operations? Our DevOps maturity assessment delves deep 
                into the key areas: Development & Testing, Release & Deployment, Monitoring & Optimisation, and Culture, 
                organisation & people. We go beyond generic assessments, focusing on your specific requirements and goals.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Approach</strong>
                Through rigorous analysis, we'll illuminate your strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities across each phase. 
                We'll translate findings into a tailored roadmap, 
                guiding you towards faster deployments, fewer errors, and a thriving DevSecOps culture.
                <br>
                <p>Every assessment is fully tailored to your needs and progress is shared continuously during the assessment, so 
                    adjustment is possible if required.
                </p>
                <br>
                <strong>Focus areas:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Development & Testing: assess coding practices, continuous integration, and testing practices.</li>
                    <li>Release & deployment: Evaluate effective use of test environments and deployment into Production.</li>
                    <li>Monitoring & optimisation: Analyse the monitoring of infrastructure, network, database, application, and optimisation processes.</li>
                    <li>Culture, organisation & people: Identify the culture, innovation, organisational processes, and people needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What do you get?</h2>
                <p><strong>Assessment outcome</strong> is a detailed analysis of the current state of your DevOps practices, identifying strengths, 
                    uncovering critical gaps, and benchmarking your processes against industry best practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategic roadmap</strong> that documents your suggested activities for the short, medium and long term.
